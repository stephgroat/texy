 test-file.texy (also tests Word, our implementation of string)
 test-file.txt (DO NOT REMOVE FILE FROM MAIN DIRECTORY)
 


OTHER TESTS:
 fail-function.texy -> duplicate function name
 test-fib.texy -> recursion succesful
 test-func1.texy -> tests simple function successfully
 test-gloabl1.texy -> tests that global vairables are recognized and working
 test-if1.texy -> control flow of IF
 test-while1.texy -> control flow of WHILE
